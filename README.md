# Project 4 - *myTwitterClient*

**myTwitterClient** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets via the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [x] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I hated working with the twitter api. really difficult. I couldn't really figure out how to get the infinite loading to work using twitter's api as well. wasted a lot of time on that
2.
